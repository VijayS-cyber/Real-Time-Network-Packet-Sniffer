# Real-Time-Network-Packet-Sniffer
This project develops a real-time network packet sniffer using Python. It captures live network packets, logs key header data into an SQLite database, detects anomalies like port scans and flooding, and displays live traffic summaries via a graphical interface with Matplotlib and Tkinter, enabling real-time network monitoring and alerts.
